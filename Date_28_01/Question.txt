1->
you are given a string as you must convert it into a integer following some strict rules
->ignore leading spaces
->check signs +/-
->read digits until a non digit is found
-> if number goes out of the integer range you have to clamp it
->if no digits just return zero
ex- hello123
output-0

ex-12@hello123
output-12

ex-12@1244
output-12

2->
